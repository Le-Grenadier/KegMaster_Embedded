Using the AzureSphere, I have created the KegMaster to secure the homebrew beer in my Keg Freezer (Keezer). The system allows me to track quantities, to set, monitor, and maintain CO2 pressure in multiple kegs, convey information about the available beverages to users via the KegMaster app, as well as control and measure flow of beverages from each keg.
